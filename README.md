# Lightbulb

Lightbulb is a blog offering users and guests a page to share their innovative ideas with interested contributors and spectators.

The blog takes a simple format and comprises of two pages, a landing page where posts are available and a review page for users to leave feedback.

The idea of the website is to provide a space where individuals can discuss ideas and find other like minded individuals, including potential collaborators and investors.

The project has been designed as a deliverable for the fourth project in the Code Institutes Diploma
in Full Stack Software Development.

Logged in users can make posts, comment and like posts. Individuals who are not logged in have read only access to all elements of the website. 

There is post approval in place in order to filter posts to assure all posts are keeping inline with what the blog endeavours to provide, this assures any distasteful posts are never seen by site users. Reviews can also be deleted by admin if they are distasteful.
